The execution plans may be the same at the moment but if either column is 
altered in the future to allow NULLs the NOT IN version will need to do more work 
(even if no NULLs are actually present in the data) and the semantics of NOT IN if
NULLs are present are unlikely to be the ones you want anyway.
