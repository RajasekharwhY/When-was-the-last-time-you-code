Merge : Advantage of merge:
Using Merge to insert, update and delete at the same time to sync the data from
source table to target table.

By using Merge we can get the performance gain (Rather than using 
Insert, Update and Delete seperately to upate in target table from the source table)
This is similar to UPSERT ( UPDATE + INSERT) command in  Oracle.

Usually following clauses:
WHEN MATCHED --> Usually used for UPDATE 
WHEN [TARGET] NOT MATCHED --> Usually used for Insert
WHEN SOURCE NOT MATCHED --> Usually used for Delete.
