select 1 from table will return the constant 1 for every row of the table. It's useful when you want to 
cheaply determine if record matches your where clause and/or join.
Good Example : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-exists/

For exammple, below two queries returns the same results : but if you uses select 1 From -> it will be a cheaper compared to 
select *

SELECT SupplierName
FROM Suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price == 18);


SELECT SupplierName
FROM Suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price == 18);
