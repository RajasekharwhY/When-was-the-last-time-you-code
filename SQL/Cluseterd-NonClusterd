Clusterd Index : Is the way of representing the base data as a whole.
---------------

Non Clusterd Index : is a phlysically seperate structure, that references the base data and it can have different sort order.
------------------

Include -> Non - Key values,  add copies of non key colum values to the leaf level of index tree. this means queries 
using the non clustered index wont have to inccur the expesnse of not having to go to the base data to get those non
key column values.

Example : 
---------
Table phone book --has 3 columns ( First Name, Last Name, Phone Number). When this table has no indexes at all and when new rows are added,
they are added where ever theere is a free space and in no perticular order. 

In the above scenario, if we have to check the phone number, we have to check every row in the table until it finds and also need to 
check other rows because it don't know same match will find remaining rows, because there
is  no order in the table. This kind of search is called SCAN (it is very in efficient) 

Perticulartly in this case , we know this is not efficient.
In phonebook names are ways stored by last name, if there are multiple last names the the lists based on first name is stored. 
In database terminalagy this is called Index key and ordered list of columns and assosiated sort directions.

Index key (Ordered list of columns)

Index Tree :
Index pages : These pages allows navigate to the directly they are intrested in. 


RID -> Row Identification ( Set of references back to the base data , with this type we can reorder any type of index key order
----
We want, because the order is  independent of base data (physical data or heap))
Heap -> Physical data 
-----

since non clustered data is not heap data (physcial data), the physcial data can exists as a clusted index.
