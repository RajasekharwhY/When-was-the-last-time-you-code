1.IEnumerable provides minimum functinality to navigate move next (but you can not call count )
2.Icollection provides minimum functionality to count ( you can count) ICollection is derived from IEnumerable so ICollection has count 
and all the functionality from IEnumeration.
3.IList supports both IEnumerable and ICollection. ( you can access by index, add range, add and remove elements)
4.List is a concrete type which implements all the above IEnumerable, ICollecgtion, IList
5.Dictionary is a key value pair, you can access the collection with key ( even if you have millions of records you can easily access them
by key.) this is the advantage of Dictionary you can easily look up by the key. 
6.Dictionary implements (IEnumerable, ICollection, IList and IDictioanry) -> is a collection of key value pairs. you can access easily the 
values stored in the dictionary by key.

1.Concurrent collection 
2.What is Thread safty ?
3.How Lazy loading haddles thread safetly
4.Thread local ? why we need thread local.
5.Difference between Lazy<T> and Lazy<T>(func<T>) 
6.Discuss about Lazy intialisation from c# in a nutshell book.
7.Lazy<T> has a value Property -> when you call the value property then only lazy intialisation is called. 
8.Lazy<T> Initialization is a thread safe (that means it protects during intialisation),
but it does not protect after creation of the object, you must lock the object before accessing it. Unless the type is thread safe. 
Thread safe objects in dot net are available in system.Collections.Concurrent --
9.Very good example is provided here from microsoft docs... https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.lazy-1?view=netframework-4.7.2#examples
