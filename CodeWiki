IEnumerable provides minimum functinality to navigate move next (but you can not call count )
Icollection provides minimum functionality to count ( you can count) ICollection is derived from IEnumerable so ICollection has count 
and all the functionality from IEnumeration.
IList supports both IEnumerable and ICollection. ( you can access by index, add range, add and remove elements)
List is a concrete type which implements all the above IEnumerable, ICollecgtion, IList
Dictionary is a key value pair, you can access the collection with key ( even if you have millions of records you can easily access them
by key.) this is the advantage of Dictionary you can easily look up by the key.
