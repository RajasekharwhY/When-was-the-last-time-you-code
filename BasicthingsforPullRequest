Things to check when submitting for pull request. 
---------------------------------------------------
1. Following naming conventions 
2. No line breaks, indentation and formatting.
3. check configfiles, if you are adding any thing exta which are not needed.
4. Remove unused refereences. (During coding time you may experimented with lot of additional libs)
5. Make sure above is a habit when you code so you dont have to take extra care seperately.
