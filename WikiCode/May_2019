Read about modules when reading about Node.js -> on nodejs environment also you can execute the javascript, other than browser. 
nodejs environment contains lot of packages that support this act like a server behavior ( like fs (file system module) http module)
those are important. 
Learning node.js means learning about all these modules, how they work and what are the methods they expose all that stuff. 
http is the important module where it has request and response objects. 
also if you practice fs file system you can understand call backs (fs version < 10.1 i guess)  and promises ( fs version > 10.01)
( Promises are advanced version of callbacks).
So if you want how to use methods using callbacks/promises these are the good places to experiment.
