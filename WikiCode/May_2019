Read about modules when reading about Node.js -> on nodejs environment also you can execute the javascript, other than browser. 
nodejs environment contains lot of packages that support this act like a server behavior ( like fs (file system module) http module)
those are important. 
Learning node.js means learning about all these modules, how they work and what are the methods they expose all that stuff. 
http is the important module where it has request and response objects. 
also if you practice fs file system you can understand call backs (fs version < 10.1 i guess)  and promises ( fs version > 10.01)
( Promises are advanced version of callbacks).
So if you want how to use methods using callbacks/promises these are the good places to experiment.

Today, I read elequent javascript book, learned about import/export when using the external modules. 
you can import the classes, objects, bindings funcitons etc... 
elequent javascript has a charpter on classes, need to read that too, and it has lot of practice excercises. 
Yesterday you read about Node.js and realised that working with some third partly modules like fs, http will 
get you understand about promises, call backs and usage of them. 

Mozilla develper is a good resource :
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import  - to practice on 
callback functions, promises.
