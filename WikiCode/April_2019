1. null ternary operator : statemnet ? : () after ? both should be of same type
2. you can use collection to exclude in side query synatax  where new list <int> {const1, const2}.contains (table.clumnvalue)
3. using of Ajax calls - when you dont want to update whole page content, supposte you have many fileds in the page and you
only want to update on filed then jqery ajax is good choice. in c# you need to pass json object and in frontend where the 
result we recieve $.parseJson("the value returned from c# object"); => this will give use the javascript object passed via 
return json(new {x = , y = , z = },  ) ;
