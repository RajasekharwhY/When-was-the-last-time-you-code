Finalyse is the destructor in c#
we have to call the dispose method in finalyse. (destructor)
Finalyse method is automatically called by clr.

so dispose() mehtod we will clean the un managed resources ( we will dispose the un managed resources ) 

what is GC.SuppressFinalize(this);  The destructor calls object.Finalise method.
-----------------------------------
Objects that implement the IDisposable interface can call this method from the object's IDisposable.Dispose 
implementation to prevent the garbage collector from calling Object.Finalize on an object that does not require it. 
Typically, this is done to prevent the finalizer from releasing unmanaged resources 
that have already been freed by the IDisposable.Dispose implementation.
