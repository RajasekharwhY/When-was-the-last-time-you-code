There are multiple frameworks avaialbe for .Net
1. MS Test
2. N Unit
3. X Unit 

you often need data for testing the code.
like customer or products. We create those data with Mocking frameworks.

The primary purpose of the unit test is that our code is functioning as expected. 

1.FaekitEasy:
2.Nsubstitute
3.Moq ( how to use code in isolation) 
 -- setup and create Moq objects
 -- setup mock methods /properties and return the values you want
 -- check the expected members are called/invoked - using behavior based testing
 --- create and testing exceptions

Different types of Moq objects : 

Fakes : 
Stubs : Provide answer to calls ..we can setup what a property returns and what a method returns 
Mocks : To check if the property was accesed or method was called.
Dummies : They never used by test code, to serve the purpose of input requirement like input to a mehtod.satisfy 

Test double - is a generic term for either stubs, Mocks , Dummies or Fakes, it is  a generic term where you are replacing 
for production object with Moq object ()
