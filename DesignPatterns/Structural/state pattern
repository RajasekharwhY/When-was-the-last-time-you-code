State and strategy looks similar they both use composition -> so you say both are same ? no 
These patterns differ by follwoing

State : object changes its behaviour based on the state. it keeps changing based on the state.

Strategy: try to remember the ducks determine the fly behaviour from the fly object they are composed with. and state pattern 
does the exact same thing it composes with object that determins its behavior (that is based on the state the system is in)
So there is a greater similarity in both state and strategy pattern.

But both are differ in their intents. (In state we are modeling the system by stepping through 
differet states of the system in a pre-determined order) which is the order of state transisions.

While strategy delegating the behaviour to class using some high level decision. And it is common just set once 
for an object , the intent is asign the behavior to class and stay with it for long time. but with sate 
we continusly changing its behavior based on the state of the object(via state diagram).
